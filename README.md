# Zelta Labs PS
I am Akshat Rai, a sophomore at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, pursuing B.Tech in Engineering Physics.  
<br />
I am targeting InterIIT Tech Meet 14.0. This problem statement by Zelta Labs came in 12.0 and 13.0 editions. In 11.0, this was given by QuantInsti, however we had to build Price Action strategies (which I'll try to build here) and do stuff on Indian Stock Market.
